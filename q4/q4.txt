Supply Chain Analytics: Correlation Matrix Visualization
OptimalFlow Logistics is a supply chain consulting firm that helps manufacturing companies optimize their procurement and inventory management processes. They analyze relationships between key supply chain metrics to identify bottlenecks, predict delivery issues, and optimize cost structures across their clients' supplier networks.

Business Context
A major automotive manufacturer has engaged OptimalFlow to analyze their supplier performance data from 77 different procurement transactions over the past quarter. The company wants to understand how different supply chain variables interact with each other to make data-driven decisions about supplier selection, inventory planning, and cost optimization.

The dataset contains these critical supply chain metrics:

Supplier_Lead_Time: Days from order placement to delivery
Inventory_Levels: Current stock quantities (units)
Order_Frequency: Number of orders placed per month
Delivery_Performance: On-time delivery rate (%)
Cost_Per_Unit: Unit cost in dollars ($)
Your Task
Create a comprehensive correlation analysis and visualization following Excel best practices from the Visualizing Forecasts with Excel module. You'll need to:

Generate Correlation Matrix: Use Excel's Data Analysis ToolPak to create a correlation matrix
Create Excel Heatmap: Apply conditional formatting with Red (low) - White - Green (high) color palette
Validate Repository: Create a GitHub repository with the required files
Detailed Steps
Download the supply chain dataset below
Import data into Excel and create correlation matrix using: Data → Data Analysis → Correlation
Copy correlation matrix to new sheet and apply conditional formatting:
Select correlation values (not labels)
Home → Conditional Formatting → Color Scales
Choose Red-White-Green palette (Red=low correlation, Green=high correlation)
Take screenshot of heatmap (400x400 to 512x512 pixels)
Export correlation matrix as CSV file
Create GitHub repository with folder containing:
README.md - contains your email: 23f3003060@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
correlation.csv - correlation matrix values
heatmap.png - screenshot of Excel conditional formatting
Excel Correlation Matrix Steps:

Enable Data Analysis ToolPak: File → Options → Add-ins → Analysis ToolPak
Data → Data Analysis → Correlation
Select all 5 data columns, check "Labels in first row"
Output to new worksheet
